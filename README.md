This project is mainly performed to analyse the Credit Risk on european Peer_to_Peer lending platform.

The input data contains financial information about users seeking loans and their applied loans.

This WebApp is to be used by bank employees to check the eligibility of the applied loan based on some demographic and financial input values. The output of our app is whether the applied loan has been accepted or denied. The whole WebApp has been built using an open-source app framework called Streamlit, and has been deployed using Heroku.

You can freely access our app through the following link:
